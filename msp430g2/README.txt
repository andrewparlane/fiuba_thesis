Software projects for the msp430g2 eval boards

I'm building using Cygwin + Windows 10 but should be simple to adapt to other environments
Requirements
    msp430-gcc:     https://www.ti.com/tool/MSP430-GCC-OPENSOURCE
    msp430flasher:  https://www.ti.com/tool/MSP430-FLASHER (note you can use UniFlash if you want a GUI)
    GRACE:          https://www.ti.com/tool/GRACE (I used this to help get started, but it's not necessary)

test:
    basic hello world project to test peripheral control.
    This was largely generated by using GRACE, which had a few bugs that I had to fix.
    Leaving with the original code as much as possible so I can diff it against future GRACE builds.
    It does the following:
        Uses the WDT in interval mode for timing. This uses interrupts)
        UART comms to the programmer chip @9600 baud 8n1
        Blinks LED1 at 1Hz
        Chase pattern on the 3 LEDs on the DLP-7970ABP booster pack board
        Writes and Reads from the TRF7970A RAM register via SPI
    Notes:
        Can be used with or without the booster pack present
        Requires the jumper for LED1.
        Requires the UART jumpers in HW mode
        LED1 is controlled by p1.0, which is the ULP Wakeup on the DLP-7970ABP booster pack board
            Not sure if this jumper being on or not will affect the TRF7970A, but might be worth
            making sure it's not there when in use with the booster pack.
