Software projects for the msp430g2 eval boards

I'm building using Cygwin + Windows 10 but should be simple to adapt to other environments
Requirements
    msp430-gcc:     https://www.ti.com/tool/MSP430-GCC-OPENSOURCE
    msp430flasher:  https://www.ti.com/tool/MSP430-FLASHER (note you can use UniFlash if you want a GUI)
    GRACE:          https://www.ti.com/tool/GRACE (I used this to help get started, but it's not necessary)

test:
    basic hello world project to test peripheral control.
    This was largely generated by using GRACE, which had a few bugs that I had to fix.
    Leaving with the original code as much as possible so I can diff it against future GRACE builds.
    It sends some UART stuff to the programmer chip @9600 baud 8n1
    And blinks an LED using the WDT in interval mode for timing
    Requires the jumper for LED1.
    LED1 is controlled by p1.0, which is the ULP Wakeup on the DLP-RFID2-ABP booster pack board
        Not sure if this jumper being on or not will affect the TRF7970A, but might be worth
        making sure it's not there when in use with the booster pack.
    Requires the UART jumpers in HW mode
