# This file determines which board gets programmed with which firmware.
# If you have multiple boards plugged in for example the reader and card_emulator,
# Then you don't want to program the card emulator fw to the board that's acting
# as the reader.

# You should have one entry per target in the format:
# target: DEVICE
# You can get the correct device to use by only having one board plugged in
# and commenting out that line. The makefile will then program whichever board is available.
# From the command line output of MSP430Flasher you will see something like:
# * Initializing interface @ COM11
# or:
# * Initializing interface @ HID0117:COM6
# copy the part from after the @ and use that as your DEVICE

#test:          COM11           # program whatever board is available for the test project
reader:         COM11
card_emulator:  HID0117:COM6
